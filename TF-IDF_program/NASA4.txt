13. ABSTRACT (maximum 200 words)
This thesis will explore the hopping mobility approach for robotic vehicles used in Intra-Vehicular
Activities (IVA) as an alternative mobility in space for small spacecraft equipped with robotic manipulators.
A hopping maneuver uses the robotic manipulator to hop between two locations inside the host spacecraft.
The maneuver is defined as three distinct phases: push, free-flying coast, and soft landing. Maneuvers such
as hopping will be used to quickly move from one part of the host spacecraft to another, with little to no fuel
consumption compared to zero-g climbing and propulsive free-flying.
This thesis answers the question, “Is there an ideal mobility for use in space that uses zero propellant?”
The concept of an IVA hopping maneuver was explored, analyzed and experimentally demonstrated in
simulation. Simulation results of such a maneuver validate hopping as a mobility approach in space. Future
work includes ground testing of the hopping maneuver and implementation onboard the International Space
Station to demonstrate an on orbit–hopping maneuver.

I. INTRODUCTION
This thesis addresses the exploration of mobility in space and the versatility of
robotic spacecraft in future space exploration. Robotics have been a cornerstone in space
and will continue to be a vehicle for interplanetary mobility. Robotics provide a resilient
platform that is able to operate in extreme environments where humans are not able to
survive. The ability to operate in extreme temperatures makes robotics the ideal vessel to
manipulate and adapt to the ever-changing environments that are present in interplanetary
exploration.
Current mobility approaches for robotic vehicles in space can be categorized into
two distinct approaches: 1) zero-g climbing and 2) propulsive free-flying. This thesis
introduces hopping as an alternative mobility method for maneuvering of small spacecraft
equipped with robotic manipulators. Mobility of such vehicles are the topic of on-going
research in regards to on-orbit servicing of satellites, mining of planetary and asteroid
bodies, space debris removal and construction of large apertures on-orbit. NASA has been
exploring on-orbit servicing since 1973, when astronauts used a servicing vehicle to repair
a heat shield (Ticker et al. 2015). The most prominent of the mission sets include, ETS-VII
(Yoshida 2003), Orbital Express (Shoemaker and Wright 2004), and Canadarm
(Sallaberger 1997). Hopping addresses the limitations of zero-g climbing and propulsive
free-flying and provides an alternative propellantless mobility in space.
A. ZERO-G CLIMBING MOBILITY APPROACH
In a zero-g climbing approach, the spacecraft uses its robotic arms to transverse the
host spacecraft by grasping onto the host spacecraft and moving between each location in
a similar manner an astronaut would transverse in space. A humanoid robot was built by
National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Johnson Space Center.
Robonaut 1 (Figure 1) consisted of two arms, two hands, one leg, and a camera for a head
(Rehnmark et al. 2004). The robot would crawl outside the space station via the handrails
that are used by astronauts to maneuver around the International Space Station (ISS)
structure. The purpose of the robot was to operate in space and alleviate the maintenance 
2
workload of astronauts by pairing with other robots to assist the astronauts during space
walks (Ambrose et al. 2000). This zero-g climbing approach is slow (1.016 cm/s) and
limited in its capability due to the need of specialized handrails for the Robonaut hands to
grasp and the limited number of handrails available around the exterior of the space station
(Rehnmark et al. 2004). Robonaut 2 was launched to the ISS in February 2011 (Ambrose
et al. 2000). The updated Robonaut 2 (Figure 2) added an additional leg to Robonaut 1 as
well as additional sensors and faster maneuverability times with a limb speed of 2 m/s
(NASA, 2018).
Figure 1. Robonaut 1. Source: Rehnmark et al. (2004).

Figure 2. Robonaut 2. Source: NASA (2018).
The limitation of zero-g climbing mobility approach is the dependence on constant
contact with the host spacecraft structure. To maneuver from one side of the host spacecraft
to the other would require climbing the perimeter of the host spacecraft. This movement is
slow in a translational direction along the edges of host structure and is limited to regions
of the host spacecraft where there are specialized handrails installed. 
4
B. PROPULSIVE FREE-FLYING MOBILITY APPROACH
The propulsive free-flying mobility approach enables spacecraft to maneuverer
quickly in space. In this alternative approach, the spacecraft utilizes the limited supply of
propellant carried onboard to move from one location to the next using onboard guidance
and navigation systems. One example of an external propulsive free-flying approach can
be found in the Autonomous Extravehicular Robotic Camera (AERCam) (Figure 3),
developed by NASA. AERCam was a free-flyer spacecraft tested in 1997 as a remote
camera capable of inspection of the external surfaces of the ISS (Chen et al. 2013).
Designed for external use, the propellant onboard provides the only fuel to maneuver the
spacecraft.
Figure 3. AERCam. Source: Chen et al. (2013).
The Japanese Space Agency created Internal Ball Camera (Int-Ball) (Figure 4), is
another example of a propulsive free-flyer for similar observatory uses internal to the ISS.
The small free-flyer is capable of capturing images previously unable to be captured by
astronauts due to the location of the wall mounted cameras onboard the ISS (Japan 
5
Aerospace Exploration Agency, 2017). Int-ball reduces the time requirements of the
astronauts to do the simple task of taking photos or videos thus freeing up the crew’s time
to conduct other experiments. As a free-flyer, the robot moves autonomously to
predetermined positions for capturing images and videos with the intention of eliminating
crew involvement in such activities. Unlike the AERCam, Int-ball is exclusively used for
internal observations and, as such, has the added environment of air flow inside the ISS.
Figure 4. JAXA Int-Ball. Source: Japan Aerospace Exploration
Agency (2017).
In addition to these free-flyers, other robotic spacecraft assist astronauts in routine
tasks and gather multimedia data via their onboard sensors. A new addition onboard the
ISS, the Crew Interactive MObile companioN (Cimon) is an experiment developed to assist
astronauts in maintenance, experimentation, and motor skills with the added capability of
access to saved files via voice commands (NASA, 2018). As the program comes online,
more information will be available on the value Cimon may have on assisting the crew.
The free-flying mobility approach is versatile and has the ability to maneuver
quickly. The limitations of such robotic spacecraft is the limited fuel onboard. Once the
fuel supply has been depleted, the spacecraft must be refueled to continue mission tasking. 
6
The mission tasking has to be prioritized based on the available fuel remaining, which
limits the capabilities of mission the robotic vehicle can perform.
C. ROBOTIC MANIPULATORS
Robotic manipulators have expanded the capability of structures built in space and
reduced the risk to astronauts by limiting EVA. The length of the robotic manipulators
extends the reach that would be achievable by an astronaut alone. Robotic manipulators
enhance the capabilities of robotic spacecraft and in terms of mobility, create a subcategory to be explored in regards to mobility in space.
Canada has contributed multiple systems in support of furthering mobility in space,
in particular modifications to the Shuttle and ISS. The collection of robotic systems
developed by Canada is the Mobile Servicing System (MSS)( Figure 5), which includes
the Mobile Base System (MBS), the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS),
and the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM). Not included in the MSS onboard
the ISS is the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) or Canadarm for short is yet
another contribution to space robotic manipulators by Canada. The Canadarm is 15 meters
in length with six joints to support Space Shuttle operations (Sallaberger 1997 pg 240).
The SSRMS or Canadarm2 is 17.1 meters in length with seven joints to support Space
Station operations (Sallaberger 1997, pg 41). Special Purpose Dexterous manipulator
(SPDM) or Dextre is two meters in length for each arm with seven joints in each arm and
the ability to conduct a degree of freedom with a body roll was built to support ISS
operations (Sallaberger 1997, pg 241) seen in Figure 6. Advances in robotics have enabled
the continued development of large structures in space. The long reach of the robotic
manipulator help astronauts assemble structures in space with minimal mobility on the part
of the astronaut. Safety of the astronauts in space is a top priority and a way to decrease
the risk includes minimizing astronaut EVA.

Canada was not the only contributor of a robotic arm to the ISS. The Japanese
Experiment Module (JEM) Remote Manipulator System (JEMRMS) and the European
Robotic Arm (ERA) were both robotic arms to the ISS. Table 1 provides a side-by-side
comparison of the three robotic arms developed for the ISS.

Engineering Test Satellite VII (ETS-VII) demonstrated on-orbit capabilities with a 2-
meter-long arm and six degrees of freedom (DOF) manipulator mounted on a host
spacecraft. The objective of the on-orbit testing was to demonstrate the ability of
rendezvous, docking and on-orbit servicing. The objective of this experiment extended to
the concept of a manipulator moving without disturbing the base-spacecraft.
9
The limitation of robotic manipulators is the reliance of humans in the loop. The
astronauts require precision maneuvers and, thus, require extensive training on each of the
robotic systems and their respective manipulators.
D. THE HOPPING MOBILITY APPROACH
Mobility in space is limited in both speed and fuel consumption. A hopping
maneuver is a new mobility approach that alleviates the limitations of zero-g climbing
approach (speed) and free-flyer (limited propellant) and the human in the loop requirement
that current robotic manipulators in space require. A hopping mobility approach is defined
when a spacecraft uses the forces applied by the manipulator to push-off and “jump”
between two locations. A hopping maneuver is comprised of three phases: push, free-flying
coast, and a soft-landing at the final location. This maneuver has the potential to be
propellantless and faster than existing mobility approaches.
This thesis will address the question, is there an ideal mobility for use in space that
uses zero propellant? A hopping mobility approach is introduced as a potential alternative
mobility approach to zero-g climbing and free-flying for robotic spacecraft equipped with
a robotic manipulator. Spacecraft equipped with a robotic arm provide a versatility for a
wide range of space missions including servicing other spacecraft, assembly of large
structures, removal of orbital debris and assisting astronauts with routine tasks.
Hopping maneuvers are not a new field of study but rather have been extensively
researched for planetary exploration by Burdick’s “Minimalist Jumping Robotics for
celestial Exploration,” Ulamec’s “Hopper Concepts for Small Body Landers,” and
Hockman’s “Stochastic Motion Planning for Hopping Rovers on Small Solar System
Bodies” to name a few. The concept focused on exploiting the gravity or lack of gravity on
other planets and how a hopping mobility approach could speed up travel time by covering
much larger distances in shorter amounts of time. Additionally, other planets have vastly
different terrains that typical travel on wheels might be difficult to travel on, hopping would
alleviate this difficulty. The concept of hopping does not need to be limited to terrestrial
mobility but is researched in this thesis as a means of mobility in space, utilizing the same
concept of exploiting the lack of gravity to the advantage of the vehicle. To demonstrate 
10
the hopping maneuver presented in this thesis, the Astrobee free-flyer developed by NASA
- Ames Research Center will be utilized as a platform to demonstrate the mobility
approach. Using the components installed on Astrobee, software was developed to exploit
and utilizes the onboard components to maneuver Astrobee propellantlessly.
E. EVOLUTION OF THE ASTROBEE PROJECT
The Astrobee free-flyer is a robotic spacecraft developed as a platform for guest
scientist research onboard the ISS. The Astrobee robotic spacecraft is an evolutionary
project that originated with the Synchronized Position Hold Engage and Reorient
Experiment Satellites (SPHERES).
1. Astrobee’s Precursor: SPHERES
SPHERES is a product of the MIT Space Systems Laboratory delivered by NASA
mission Expedition 8 to the ISS and remains an active experiment onboard. SPHERES
(Figure 7) consists of three free-flying robotic spacecraft, provide an educational platform
for researchers to test navigation, maneuvering, and guidance control implementation on
multiple spacecraft simultaneously (McCamish et al. 2009). Shaped like spheres, these
satellites fly inside the ISS and test autonomous rendezvous and docking maneuvers. The
SPHERES research platform laid the groundwork for the next generation of robotics in
space like NASA’s free-flyer, Astrobee (NASA, International Space Station Basics).
11

SPHERES (2017).
SPHERES requires constant astronaut supervision during all experiments. Astrobee
will serve as the replacement to SPHERES and builds off many of the same features as
AERCam and PSA in respect to free-flying capabilities. Due to the autonomous free-flying
ability that Astrobee is projected to have, will require little to no astronaut supervisor which
would alleviate the consuming time demands of the SPHERES experiments (Smith et al.
2016).
2. Astrobee Anatomy
Astrobee is a free-flying autonomous robot designed for Inter-Vehicular Activity
(IVA) inside the ISS. The basic components of Astrobee are identified in Figure 8. The
mechanical arm pictured is the manipulator developed by the NASA team. NPS colleagues
are researching a more dexterous manipulator for Astrobee but the software for this thesis
was developed with initial NASA manipulator arm. 
12

3. Astrobee’s Current Mission Capabilities
The current mission capability for Astrobee is to use its manipulator arm to perch
itself. Astrobee has installed fans to propel and stabilize itself. Each unit is equipped with
camera for experiment observations and Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) features to
enable the vehicle to maneuver throughout the space station (autonomously) (Smith et al.
2016). From the perched position, the camera can focus on the astronauts during scientific
research and testing. Astronauts can maneuver the spacecraft to any handrail that would be
best for viewing the experiment. The range of motion of the manipulator arms suggests
that Astrobee could actuate the manipulator over the range to ramp up the velocity on the
joints and push itself from handrail to handrail.
F. PREVIOUS WORK
This thesis is a continuation of previous work done by Naval Postgraduate School
(NPS) thesis student Andrew Bradstreet, whose thesis work explored the study of a push
and planar hopping maneuver of robots (Bradstreet 2018). The platform for this planar
hopping maneuver was Manipulator Satellite (ManiSat), the Spacecraft Robotics
Laboratory’s (SRL’s) Floating Spacecraft Simulator (FSS). Bradstreet performed both 
13
simulations and hardware testing on the SRL’s test-bed, Proximity Operation of
Spacecraft: Experimental hardware-In-the-loop Dynamic Simulator (POSEIDYN). The
goal of his experiments was to prove the feasibility of a propellantless push/catch
maneuver. ManiSat, performed a self-toss from the left handrail with the direction of
motion to the right handrail as pictured in Figure 9. The floating robot entered a free-flying
coast upon the gripper’s release of the handrail until ManiSat reached the opposite handrail,
at which time executed a soft-landing. The results of the experiment validate the hopping
maneuver and its ability to propellantlessly maneuver a spacecraft.

NPS Planar Air Bearing Test-Bed. Source: Bradstreet (2017).
G. THESIS OVERVIEW
This unique hopping maneuver, developed at NPS, will be the first on-orbit
demonstration of a non-traditional maneuver approach. This thesis will cover both the
theory and formulation of the control algorithms used and the implementation of the
controllers. The following chapters will outline the development, simulation, testing, and
concept of operations for an on-orbit demonstrations of the hopping maneuver of NASA -
Ames Research Center’s free-flyer, Astrobee. Chapter II provides formulation of the
general hooping mobility approach. Chapter III explains in detail the simulation
experiments. Chapter IV will present the results of the experiments. Chapter V will explain
the implementation of the hopping maneuver onboard the ISS and provide a detailed
concept of operation for the ISS experiments. Chapter VI will be all conclusions from this
thesis.

II. IVA ROBOTIC SPACECRAFT HOPPING
Here the equation of motion formulation and guidance strategy for an IVA hopping
maneuver is presented in detail. To help in the formulation, the maneuver divides into three
phases: push, free-flying coast, and soft-landing. Each phase outlines in detail with the
governing equations derived therein for the general case of a hopping maneuver.
A. HOPPING: A THREE-PHASED MANEUVER
A spacecraft hopping maneuver is conceptually divided into three phases in which
a robotic vehicle hops between two locations on the host spacecraft. Phase one of a hopping
maneuver is a push motion, in which the hopping spacecraft uses its robotic manipulator
to exert a motion against the host spacecraft, propelling the hopping spacecraft towards its
final destination. At the time the gripper releases the handrail, the hopping spacecraft enters
phase two, called the free-flying coast phase. The final phase of a hopping maneuver is the
soft landing of the hopping spacecraft at the desired end location. Figure 10 illustrates
conceptual division into three phases.

B. FORMULATION
The governing equations for each phase are here derived. To do so, the following
assumptions are made:
• The robotic vehicle consists of multiple rigid body systems moving in
three-dimensional space.
• Relative orbital dynamic effects are negligible due to the close proximity
of the hopping spacecraft to the host spacecraft.
• All properties (state and inertia) of the hopping robotic vehicle are known.
• Ideal contact dynamics exist between the hopping vehicle and the host
spacecraft.
1. Equations of Motion of a Free-Flying Robotic Multibody System
The generalized coordinates of the base-spacecraft are position (𝒓𝒓0) and orientation
(𝜽𝜽0) as written in Equation 1.
𝒒𝒒𝟎𝟎 = �

𝜽𝜽𝟎𝟎

The generalized joint positions for a manipulator of the multibody system are
written in Equation 2, where N denotes the number of joints.

The hopping maneuver for a multibody system can be represented by the
generalized equations of motion (Dubowsky et al. 1993) written as Equation 6:
𝑯𝑯𝒒𝒒̈+ 𝑪𝑪𝒒𝒒̇ = 𝝉𝝉 (6)
where 𝝉𝝉 is the generalized torques. The generalized inertia matrix 𝑯𝑯 is a function of 𝒒𝒒 for
the multibody system. The generalized convective inertia matrix of the system is 𝑪𝑪 and is
a function of 𝒒𝒒 and 𝒒𝒒̇ of the base and joints. Equation 6 can therefore be defined by
subscript notation 0 for the base-spacecraft and subscript m for the manipulator as is written
in Equation 7:

Matrices 𝑯𝑯 and 𝑪𝑪 can be computed via SRL’s SPAcecraft Robotics Toolkit (SPART)
software (Virgili-Llop et al. 2018). This software inputs a user defined robot with all its
corresponding parameters and generates the robot model, Jacobians, inertia matrices 𝑯𝑯,
and convective inertia matrices 𝑪𝑪.

The Jacobian describes the motion of the end-effector based on the rotation of the
manipulator joints results with a change in attitude and position of the base (Wilde et at.
2018).
2. Equations of Motion During the Push
A hopping maneuver begins with the robotic spacecraft attached to the handrail in
what is called a perched mode. This is both a stationary position and the starting position
of the hopping maneuver. From the perched position, the robotic spacecraft is rigidly
attached to the handrail. The manipulator attached to the hopping spacecraft provide three
degrees of freedom to orient the vehicle towards its desired final destination.
The push is the initial motion of the hopping mobility approach. From the perched
position, the robotic spacecraft’s gripper is attached to the handrail while the manipulator
joints are actuated. The end-effector maintains rigid connection with the host spacecraft
and the mapping between joint velocities and the end-effector velocities are expressed:
𝒕𝒆 ൌ𝟎ൌ𝑱𝟎,𝑬𝒒ሶ
𝟎 ൅ 𝑱𝒎,𝑬𝒒ሶ
𝒎 (12)
𝒕𝒆 ൌ𝟎ൌ𝑱𝟎,𝑬𝒖𝟎 ൅ 𝑱𝒎,𝑬𝒖𝒎 (13)
the resulting velocities of the base-spacecraft during the push are obtained as follows:
𝒒ሶ
𝟎 ൌ െ𝑱𝟎,𝑬
ି𝟏 𝑱𝒎,𝑬𝒒ሶ
𝒎 (14)
Upon the completion of the push, the gripper releases propelling the hopping
spacecraft in the oriented direction and exploits a desired linear and angular velocity of the
hopping vehicle to reach the final destination. The momenta of the system during the push
is as follows:
𝓜 ൌ ൫𝑯𝟎𝒎 െ 𝑯𝟎𝑱𝟎,𝑬
ି𝟏 𝑱𝒎,𝑬൯𝒒ሶ
𝒎 (15)
3. Equations of Motion During the Free-Flying Coast
The moment the gripper releases the handrail, the free-flying coast phase of the
hopping maneuver begins. If no forces are applied to the multibody system then the 
19
momenta of the system is constant and the governing equations of the multibody system
are as follows:
𝝉𝝉𝟎𝟎 = 𝟎𝟎 (16)
𝓜𝓜 → 𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄 (17)
𝒓𝒓̇
𝒄𝒄 = 𝓟𝓟
𝒎𝒎𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕
→ 𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄 (18)
The velocity of the base is, in general, not constant (as 𝑯𝑯0 is a function of 𝒒𝒒 and
thus changes with orientation, 𝜽𝜽)
𝒒𝒒̇
𝟎𝟎 = 𝑯𝑯𝟎𝟎
−𝟏𝟏(𝓜𝓜 − 𝑯𝑯𝟎𝟎𝟎𝟎𝒒𝒒̇
𝒎𝒎) (19)
If propulsion is used during the free-flying phase, the momenta would no longer be
conserved. This part of the phase does have the option of using onboard propulsion to
produce mid-course corrections as needed but the equations of motion during the freeflying coast were formulated without the use of the propulsion system. Errors may derive
from imperfect release conditions during the push from the handrail. These errors can be
corrected by modifying the translational trajectory to achieve the initial desired end
location
4. Equations of Motion During the Landing
The soft-landing ends the maneuver when the gripper grasps the handrail with a
zero relative velocity between the arm and the stationary handrail of the host spacecraft.
𝒕𝒕𝒆𝒆 = 𝟎𝟎 = 𝑱𝑱𝟎𝟎,𝑬𝑬𝒒𝒒̇
𝟎𝟎 + 𝑱𝑱𝒎𝒎,𝑬𝑬𝒒𝒒̇
𝒎𝒎 (20)
With 𝒒𝒒̇
0 defined from Equation 18 and 𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒 from Equation 19, 𝒒𝒒̇
𝑚𝑚 is as follows:
𝒒𝒒̇
𝒎𝒎 = �𝑱𝑱𝟎𝟎,𝑬𝑬𝑯𝑯𝟎𝟎
−𝟏𝟏𝑯𝑯𝟎𝟎𝟎𝟎 − 𝑱𝑱𝒎𝒎,𝑬𝑬�
−𝟏𝟏�𝑱𝑱𝟎𝟎,𝑬𝑬𝑯𝑯𝟎𝟎
−𝟏𝟏𝓜𝓜� (21)
The movement of the arm to counter the rotation of the hopping spacecraft is
desired to catch the handrail with a relative zero velocity between the stationary host
handrail and the hopping spacecraft. 
20
The free-fly coast phase is further categorized into two categories, a passive phase
and an active phase. The second phase of the free-flying coast maneuver is known as the
active phase due to the active moving of the manipulator with respect to the hopping
vehicle during the coast. Due to the moving of the manipulator 𝒒𝒒̇
0 changes throughout this
phase of the maneuver. The second phase of the free-flying coast maneuver is the beginning
of the soft-landing maneuver.
C. PLANNING A HOPPING MANEUVER
Figure 11 notionally shows the geometric definition of a hopping maneuver. All
vectors are projected onto the inertial Cartesian Coordinate System.
Figure 11. Hopping Spacecraft Definitions.
The problem formulation consists of both direct and inverse hopping problems. The
direct formulation consists of solving for the trajectory once the generalized variables are
known. The inverse formulation consists of solving for the trajectory given specified
hopping inputs i.e., start and end locations.
1. Direct Hopping Problem
In the direct hopping problem, the generalized variables of the multibody system
are known. Given that the position, 𝒓𝒓𝑒𝑒 and the orientation 𝜽𝜽𝑒𝑒 of the end-effector and the 𝒒𝒒
of the system are known, then the kinematics can be solved for, providing the trajectory of
the hopping maneuver. 
21
For the push, Equation 22 holds true.
�
𝒓𝒓𝒆𝒆
𝜽𝜽𝒆𝒆
� → 𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄 (22)
During this phase, 𝒒𝒒̇
𝑚𝑚 is a controlled input. Note that the manipulator is velocitycontrolled, thus the configuration at any time during the hopping maneuver is simply the
integration of 𝒒𝒒̇
𝑚𝑚. At the time of release, the manipulator configuration, 𝒒𝒒𝑚𝑚 and
manipulator velocity 𝒒𝒒̇
𝑚𝑚 are therefore known. Using Equation 14, the momenta of the
system can be computed.
For the free-flying coast, the center-of-mass is constant (Equation 17). The
manipulator is assumed to be fixed during the initial free-flying coast and thus the basespacecraft velocity, 𝒒𝒒̇
0 can be solved for with Equation 18. The trajectory is thus solved
for by integrating 𝒒𝒒̇
0 to get the 𝒒𝒒0 (position and orientation) of the base-spacecraft over the
course of the free-flying coast phase of the hopping maneuver.
During the soft-landing, the manipulator velocity (𝒒𝒒̇
𝑚𝑚) is as written in Equation 23
until the end-effector grasps the destination handrail, at which time, the base-spacecraft
velocity (𝒒𝒒̇
0) will obey Equation 24.
𝒒𝒒̇
𝒎𝒎 = �𝑱𝑱𝟎𝟎,𝑬𝑬𝑯𝑯𝟎𝟎
−𝟏𝟏𝑯𝑯𝟎𝟎𝟎𝟎 − 𝑱𝑱𝒎𝒎,𝑬𝑬�
−𝟏𝟏�𝑱𝑱𝟎𝟎,𝑬𝑬𝑯𝑯𝟎𝟎
−𝟏𝟏𝓜𝓜� (23)
𝒒𝒒̇
𝟎𝟎 = −𝑱𝑱𝟎𝟎,𝑬𝑬
−𝟏𝟏 𝑱𝑱𝒎𝒎,𝑬𝑬𝒒𝒒̇
𝒎𝒎 (24)
The goal of a soft-landing is to have the difference between the free-flying coast
velocity (Equation 18) and the velocity of the base-spacecraft (Equation 24) following the
moment the end-effector grips the destination handrail to be zero.
Once the base-spacecraft is grasping the final handrail, 𝒒𝒒̇
𝑚𝑚 goes to zero after which
time, the hopping maneuver is complete.
2. Inverse Hopping Problem
In the inverse hopping problem, the initial position, 𝒒𝒒0 of the hopping spacecraft
is known. The corresponding release configuration of the manipulator needs to be solved 
22
for. The inverse hopping maneuver takes a range of kinematic solutions found from the
direct hopping problem and correlates the hopping spacecraft’s current height with the
closest height data point to get the corresponding release configuration of the manipulator.
D. CONCLUSION
A planar hopping maneuver is feasible with small spacecraft equipped with a
robotic manipulator. This simple hopping maneuver is constructed in such a way that the
only control variable is the point of release determined by the orientation of the
manipulator. The limited factor in the hopping maneuver therefore is the range of motion
the manipulator is capable of (DOF).

III. SIMULATED HOPPING MANEUVERS WITH THE
ASTROBEE FREE-FLYER
To showcase and verify the proposed mobility approach, the Astrobee free-flyer is
used for simulation of the hopping maneuver inside the simulated ISS. With the current
hardware installed on the robot, Astrobee could perform a hopping maneuver by actuating
joints in the manipulator to hop between two locations. The range of the manipulator and
the velocities the joints, create a platform to conduct IVA hopping without additional
hardware; merely a software upgrade could make Astrobee the first robotic spacecraft to
hop in space. Results of the hopping maneuver simulate the inside of the ISS.
The goal is for Astrobee to start from a perched configuration on an ISS handrail
and push itself off the handrail, free-fly coast across the space station, and catch itself via
a soft-landing. The simulated hopping maneuver provides proof of concept for ground test
experiments as well as the ISS experiment. The data collected in the simulated environment
will in future work be compared with ground tests to validate the correct forces and
ultimately to provide validation to the experiment for safety purposes prior to the ISS
experiment.
A. ASTROBEE
NASA – Ames’ free-flyer robot, Astrobee is an available platform to conduct
control algorithms through the available guest scientist research program put forth by
NASA. The hopping mobility approach of this thesis, commonly called astrobatics due to
the gymnastic characterizes of the backflip involved in the maneuver is a software only
payload that can be uploaded to the free-flyer while in the ISS. Prior to conducting
experiments onboard the ISS, simulated and ground testing must first demonstrate the
feasibility of the maneuver and demonstrate the hopping maneuver is safe for testing in the
ISS.
The simulated planar Astrobee experiment consists of a base spacecraft and six
manipulator links. The six joint positions of Astrobee’s manipulator are written in Equation
25, named in Table 2 and the associated links are displayed in Figures 12 and 13.

The linear velocity envelope of what Astrobee’s joints and links are capable of
achieving are displayed in Figures Figure 18 and Figure 19. The results indicate that
Astrobee can conduct a hopping maneuver in any direction. The results also indicate that
Astrobee can push itself off the handrail and perch itself back on the same handrail. More
importantly, the data shows that the max velocity of the hopping maneuver does not exceed 
28
the max velocity of the joints or the max velocity (~2.1 m/s) for free-flying robots in the
ISS (Smith et al. 2016).

B. A PLANAR HOP WITH ASTROBEE
A planar hopping maneuver reduces the dynamics of the problem to a 2D planar
motion, with the initial position of Astrobee’s Arm Proximal Joint extended from the
handrail at a determined height. The spacecraft completes the maneuver rotating about a
single axis. The contact dynamics for the release are idealized and the grippers are opened
and closed at the same rate so as to have no collisions with the gripper and the handrail.
When the grippers are commanded open, the grippers release with no additional friction or
delay. Further ground-based experiments must be conducted to verify if the real-world
dynamics are equal to the idealized conditions for the simulation experiment with Astrobee.
C. SIMULATION EXPERIMENT WITH ASTROBEE
Due to software limitations, the application velocity to joints was infeasible. As
such, to accomplish this planar hopping experiment, the only control variable is the
configuration of the manipulator at the point of release. The range of possible ranges of the
manipulator at release for a hard-landing hopping maneuver are found in Table 4. The
height and range values in Table 4 can be correlated to the schematic of the hard-landing
displayed in Figure 20.

D. INITIALIZATION MODE
When the hopping maneuver is initiated, the initial position of Astrobee is measured
and compared with Table 4 to determine the corresponding Arm Proximal joint
configuration associated with the height of Astrobee. The initial position of Astrobee
perched on handrail is pictured in Figure 22. 
34
Figure 22. Astrobee Perched on ISS Handrail in Simulated ISS
Environment.
Table 4 and Table 5 provide the release configuration, 𝒒𝒒𝒎𝒎 at the exact moment of
release and the associated height and range of the hopping maneuver.
1. Inputs
The inputs to the initialization mode controller are:
(a) 𝒒𝒒𝑚𝑚 : The joint positions of the manipulator.
(b) 𝒒𝒒̇
𝑚𝑚 : The velocities of the manipulator joints.
Prior to initialization mode, Astrobee is positioned in a random location and
configuration. The onboard sensors of Astrobee determine the location of the robot and
hopping maneuver software determines the inputs for the initialization mode calculated in
Table 4 and Table 5 for the respective maneuver. The inputs are then fed into the
initialization controller. The two inputs correspond to one revolution of Astrobee for a
successful hopping maneuver. 
35
2. Outputs
The outputs to the initialization mode controller are:
(a) 𝝉𝝉𝑚𝑚: Torque applied to manipulator.

Output from the initialization controller command Astrobee to the push
configuration with the grippers rigidly attached to the handrail. Completion flag signals
that the controller has completed all tasks and is ready to enter the next mode.
3. Completion Criteria
The initialization mode controller measures the initial position and orientation of
Astrobee, with a closed gripper, rigidly attached to the handrail, and then imparts a
proportional feedback controller to command the joints of Astrobee to the required
configuration to complete the hopping maneuver. The completion criteria are:
(a) 𝒒𝒒𝒎𝒎_𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓 − 𝒒𝒒𝒎𝒎 = 𝒒𝒒𝒎𝒎_𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕 where 𝒒𝒒𝒎𝒎_𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕 = 0.1 deg
(b) 𝒒𝒒̇

𝒎𝒎 = 𝒒𝒒̇
𝒎𝒎_𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕 where 𝒒𝒒̇
𝒎𝒎_𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕 = 0.05 deg/s
When both criteria are met, the initiation mode is complete and enables the push
mode.
E. PUSH MODE
The push initiates on the receipt of the completion flag from the initialization mode.

(c) 𝑭𝑭0: Force on the base-spacecraft.
(d) Completion flag: Indication that the maneuver has been completed.
Output from the push controller indicates Astrobee ready to release from the
handrail at the determined manipulator configuration. Completion flag signals that the
controller has completed all tasks and is ready to enter the next mode.
3. Completion Criteria
The push actuates the joints of Astrobee and imparts a proportional feedback
controller to command Astrobee to the proper release position 𝒒𝒒𝒎𝒎𝟏𝟏
𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍 where 𝒒𝒒𝟏𝟏 was
calculated in the initiation mode based off of initial position of Astrobee. The completion

(b) 𝒒𝒒𝒎𝒎𝟏𝟏
𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓 = 𝒒𝒒𝟏𝟏
When both criteria are met, the push mode is complete and the free-flying coast
mode is enabled.
F. FREE-FLYING PASSIVE COAST MODE
1. Inputs
The inputs to the free-flying passive coast mode controller are:
(a) 𝒒𝒒𝑚𝑚 : The joint positions of the manipulator.
(b) 𝒒𝒒̇
𝑚𝑚 : The velocities of the manipulator joints.
(c) 𝒓𝒓0 : Position of base-spacecraft
37
(d) 𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 : Direction Cosine Matrix – Body frame to inertia frame
2. Outputs
The outputs to the free-flying passive coast mode controller are:
(a) 𝝉𝝉𝑚𝑚: Torque applied to manipulator.

(c) 𝑭𝑭0: Force on the base-spacecraft.
(d) Time: Log time.
(e) Completion flag: Indication that the maneuver has been completed.
Output from the free-fly coast controller indicates Astrobee has released from the
handrail and is in free-flying passive coast mode with the manipulator fixed in the release
configuration. Completion flag signals that the controller has completed all tasks and is
ready to enter the next mode.
3. Completion Criteria
Astrobee’s manipulator is held fixed to the release position 𝒒𝒒𝒎𝒎𝟏𝟏
𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓 . The
completion criteria is:
(a) 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝒓𝒓𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝒒𝒒0) − 𝒛𝒛𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 > 𝟎𝟎 where 𝒛𝒛𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 = 0.
The 𝒛𝒛𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 is set to zero for the hard-landing maneuver as the gripper will not move prior
to grasping the handrail.
When the completion criteria is met, the free-flying coast passive mode is complete
and the free-flying active coast mode is enabled.
G. FREE-FLYING COAST ACTIVE MODE
1. Inputs
The inputs to the free-flying active coast mode controller are:
(a) 𝒒𝒒𝑚𝑚 : The joint positions of the manipulator. 
38
(b) 𝒒𝒒̇
𝑚𝑚 : The velocities of the manipulator joints.
(c) 𝒓𝒓0 : Position of the base-spacecraft.
(d) Time: Logged time.
(e) 𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 : Direction Cosine Matric: Body frame to inertial frame.
2. Outputs
The outputs to the free-fly active coast mode controller are:
(a) 𝝉𝝉𝑚𝑚: Torque applied to manipulator.
(b) 𝝉𝝉0 = 0
(c) 𝑭𝑭0 = 0
(d) Time: Log time.
(e) Completion flag: Indication that the maneuver has been completed.
Outputs from the free-flying active coast controller indicate Astrobee is in freeflying active coast mode with the manipulator actively moving to negate the angular
velocity. Completion flag signals that the controller has completed all tasks and is ready to
enter the next mode.
3. Completion Criteria
Astrobee’s manipulator is no longer held fixed to the release position 𝒒𝒒𝒎𝒎𝟏𝟏
𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓 but
is moving to counter the rotation of Astrobee to enable a soft-landing. If a hard-landing has
been programed, this mode will not be entered. The completion criteria is:
(a) 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝒓𝒓𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝒒𝒒0) − 𝒛𝒛𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 > 𝟎𝟎 where 𝒛𝒛𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 = 0.
The 𝒛𝒛𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 is set to zero for the soft-landing maneuver. The initial position of the base of
Astrobee was increased to allow time for the manipulator to ramp up to the needed velocity.
The manipulator must be opposite and equal to the rotation of the base to negate the angular
rotation of the spacecraft. The moment the velocity of the manipulator equals the velocity
of the rotation of the spacecraft, the gripper will grasp the handrail. 
39
When the completion criteria is met, the free-flying coast active mode is complete
and the landing mode is enabled.
H. SELF-STABILIZER MODE
The stabilizer controller is the only controller that actively uses propellant. The
purpose of this controller is to act as a safety-net in the event the spacecraft needs to cancel
hopping maneuver.

𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓 𝒂𝒂𝒔𝒔𝒔𝒔. The
completion criteria are:
(a) time > 5 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠
(b) Astrobee positioned at the (0,0,0)
When the completion criteria are met, the stabilization mode is complete and the
maneuver is disabled.
I. LANDING MODE
The passive actuation of the proximal joint is defined in the final landing phase as
a hard-landing if the robotic manipulator remains stationary during the coast phase. The
manipulator remains stationary in order to keep the release configuration equal to the catch
configuration. The spacecraft will complete a 270 degree rotation from handrail to handrail.
The proximal joint deflection is the only control variable and the starting height with the
joint deflection determine the landing location.
To achieve a softer-landing, approximately the last five seconds of the hopping
maneuver, immediately prior to perching, the hopping spacecraft will actuate the proximal
joint to eliminate the relative angular velocity. The absence of angular velocity by
definition will achieve a relative velocity of zero between the hopping vehicle and the
stationary handrail, which creates the desired effect of a “soft-landing.” An ideal relative
velocity of zero is not possible with Astrobee due to the DOF of the manipulator. The
angular velocity can be eliminated but not the linear velocity. Prior to the hopping
maneuver, the required joint deflection for the ramp up of the soft-landing is a fixed
parameter. The actuation of the proximal joint changes the spacecraft’s rotation.

J. CONCLUSION
Planar hopping maneuver is possible with NASA - Ames Research Center’s Freeflyer, Astrobee. The release configuration of the manipulator is the only control variable
for a planar hopping maneuver with Astrobee. As such, height and range are associated
with the release configuration. Due to the DOF of Astrobee’s manipulator, achieving a
soft-landing is only applicable in negating the angular velocity. Future work includes,
targeting a specific range by moving the manipulator during free-flying coast phase and
creating a more versatile manipulator with additional DOF to negate the linear velocity of
Astrobee to truly achieve a relative velocity of zero in the soft-landing.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
Results from numerical simulation experiments are presented in this chapter. Two
simulation experiments were conducted to verify the hopping maneuver concept. The first
of the simulation experiments is the demonstration of the hard-landing with the passive
proximal joint deflection. The second simulation experiment is the implementation of the
soft-landing proximal-joint actuation. All experiment results verify the hopping maneuver
concept and provide data to be compared with ground based tests. Purpose of simulation
and ground based testing is to validate the hopping maneuver concept and the likelihood
of a successful hopping maneuvers in zero-gravity environment.
A. HARD-LANDING HOPPING SIMULATION
Simulation begins with Astrobee perched on the handrail. Moments before the time
of release, the proximal joint is actuated to create the push mode. The simulation imposes
a constant velocity on the joint until the proximal joint matches the defined release
configuration. The deflection then stops, the joint velocity is now zero, and Astrobee enters
into free-fly coast mode. During this phase, the proximal joint is held fixed. The landing
mode is the mode in which Astrobee catches the handrail at the final location inside the
simulated ISS environment. Figure 23 illustrates the hopping maneuver and defines the
terms range and height with respect to the experiment set up. Figure 24 displays the results
of the simulated hopping maneuvers, displaying the height and range of 14 hopping
maneuvers all of which are within the range of values described in Table 4. Astrobee begins
at a given height located on the right hand side of the graph and ends the maneuver at a
determined range (Table 4) on the left hand side of the graph. The figure has the height
defined on the right-hand axis label to visually mirror the experiment seen in the schematic
of Figure 23.

Figure 24. Location of Base during Hard-Landing Hopping Maneuver. 
45
The proximal joint deflection over the span of the hopping maneuvers are displayed
in Figure 25. The proximal joint is actuated for the push phase and then held fixed for the
duration of the hopping maneuver indicated by the straight line in Figure 25. During the
catch phase, the proximal joint is again actuated to grasp the handrail and complete the
hopping maneuver.
Figure 25. Hard-Landing Proximal Joint Position
The forces experienced during the maneuver are of interest and are displayed in
Figure 26. The results indicate that approximately 2 Newton of force are experienced
during the push. Ground based experiments will test the dynamics with real-world
environments. The ground based experiments will need to be less than 2 Newton for these
simulated experiments to verify the hopping maneuver concept.

Maneuver.
B. SOFT-LANDING HOPPING SIMULATION
Simulation begins with Astrobee perched on the handrail. Moments before the time
of release, the proximal joint is actuated to make up the push mode. Once the proximal
joint reaches the release configuration, the deflection stops as Astrobee enters into free-fly
coast mode. During the majority of this phase, the proximal joint is held fixed until the
simulation enters active joint landing in which the joint is no longer held fixed and moves
to counter the angular velocity. The landing mode is the mode in which Astrobee catches
the handrail at the final location inside the simulated ISS environment. Figure 27 illustrates
the soft-landing hopping maneuver and defines the terms range and height with respect to
the experiment set up. Figure 28 displays the results of the simulated hopping maneuvers,
displaying the height and range of 10 hopping maneuvers all of which are within the range 
47
of values described in Table 5 . Astrobee begins at a given height located on the right hand
side of the graph and ends the maneuver at a determined range (Table 5 ) on the left hand
side of the graph. The figure has the height defined on the right-hand axis label to visually
mirror the experiment seen in the schematic of Figure 27.
Changes to the hard-landing are as follows. The software is not changed but rather
the hard-landing command never enters active joint phase of the free-flying coast whereas
soft-land not only completes the free-flying coast passive joint but then enters the active
joint phase.

Figure 28. Location of Base during Soft-Landing Hopping Maneuver.
The proximal joint deflection over the span of a hopping maneuver are displayed
in Figure 29. The proximal joint is actuated for the push and actuated again prior to the
catch indicated by the rounded curve near the end of the maneuver. During the catch phase,
the grippers grasp the handrail and complete the hopping maneuver. 
49
Figure 29. Soft-Landing Proximal Joint Position
The forces experienced during the maneuver are of interest and are displayed in
Figure 30. The results indicate that approximately 2 Newton of force are experienced
during the push. Ground based experiments will test the dynamics with real-world
environments. The ground based experiments will need to be less than 2 Newton for these
simulated experiments to verify the hopping maneuver concept.

V. PLANNED ISS EXPERIMENT
The ISS provides a safe environment to conduct zero-gravity experiments for
hopping maneuvers. Research facilities onboard the ISS support a risk free platform to
conduct microgravity experiments. The dynamic environment of the ISS are ideal for
testing guidance and control algorithms for maneuverability of spacecraft in space.
Astrobee provides the robotic vehicle necessary to demonstrate advanced control algorithm
and will be the platform of choice for this thesis. Through guest scientist research, this
thesis experiment is capable of implementation onboard the ISS. Bi-weekly meetings with
the NASA - Ames Research team and quarterly updates to the SPHERES/Astrobee
working group provided the ground work necessary to make this thesis experiment possible
with fastest integration to NASA’s flight software. Accessibility to the ISS research facility
where Astrobee will conduct the experiments is limited to software updates only to the
robotic vehicle via NASA - Ames Research Center control center.
As a Department of Defense entity, Space Experiments Review Board (SERB)
approval is required to get approval to run an experiment onboard the ISS and to be added
to a mission manifest. The objective for conducting a hopping maneuver onboard the ISS
is to conduct on-orbit demonstration of the hopping mobility approach. The approved
mission manifest and the concept of operations for the experiment setup is discussed in
detail in this chapter. The impact of this on-orbit demonstration is to advance orbital
robotics technology with application to include on-orbit servicing and assembly of large
apertures in space.
A. CONCEPT OF OPERATION
Mission manifest includes five on-orbit experiment sessions. The scheduled
sessions are designed in such a way to increase in complexity allowing time to implement
lessons learned between experiment sessions. Table 6 identifies the goals for each session.
Sessions are scheduled for three-hour time slots. The first three experiments require
reserved astronaut time to provide a safety net for the robot in the case of unexpected
telemetry. One of the three Astrobee that is not involved in the maneuver will also act as a 
52
third party observer along side the astronauts but unlike the astronauts the robot will not be
able to reposition the maneuvering Astrobee or reset the robot as needed for the duration
of the experiment.

S5 Margin.
B. QUALITY OF THE EXPERIMENT
On-orbit demonstration of the hopping maneuver will be the first on-orbit
demonstration of a propellantless hopping maneuver. Successful laboratory testing and
numerical simulations suggest high likelihood of success. Advances orbital robotic
mobility, complementing to other Department of Defense (DoD) research programs.
C. PLAN OF IMPLEMENTATION
This experiment is low-risk and low-cost due to the integration with Astrobee
strictly software and with no hardware components to modify the spacecraft. The make up
of the experiment leverages ISS assets and NASA - Ames Research Center’s Astrobee
mission control center. Overall the research done is educational in nature and adds value
to NPS students through Masters thesis exposure to flight experimentation. Guest Scientist
Research is a pivotal make up for the ISS and as such is the ideal platform to conduct
propellantless hopping maneuvers. Requested services onboard the ISS are Astronaut
Support for limited Astrobee handling (Astrobee is expected to be autonomous), video
footage of the experiment, and data uplink/downlink capabilities. 
53
D. FLIGHT REQUIREMENTS
No additional flight hardware. Experiments use Astrobee free-flyer onboard ISS.
ASTROBATICS only requires to uplink a software executable to the Astrobee free-flyer.
On-orbit experimentation required to demonstrate and validate hopping maneuver in the
relevant dynamic environment. Hardware-related dynamic effects, such as contacts
dynamics, are difficult to accurately recreate on a simulation environment. Experiments on
a numerical simulation and on a reduced dynamic environment on the lab. have already
been conducted.
E. TRANSITION PLAN
Use of NASA - Ames Research Center’s Astrobee control center to command and
downlink experiment data. PI receives experiment data and is responsible for analysis and
dissemination. Scientific results published as peer-reviewed publications in top-ranked
journals and scientific conferences. Astronautical Engineering Masters students’
involvement during the development, operations, and analysis.
F. MILITARY RELEVANCE
Improved robotics capabilities for on-orbit servicing or assembly. Unique interspacecraft transport capability. More capable/reliable/resilient space assets for national
security as a result. Objects in space are increasing yearly. With each new satellite brings
additional space debris that clutters the orbital planes. Military assets could use the
servicing robot as an extra set of eyes on orbit. The options are endless. A camera could
give real-time telemetry to display all hazards near the satellite. The camera could range
from a real-time picture to an inferred sensor. The robot would have the agility to reposition
itself in any orientation around the satellite to provide better viewing of potential obstacles.
The servicing satellite could exam the physical condition of the target satellite to give
visual feedback of the current condition of the satellite. This would provide vital
information to ground crews to assess any repairs. Servicing vehicles would have installed
dexterous arms that could complete rudimentary repairs as needed to further the life of the
mission.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
The hopping mobility approach for a muiltibody spacecraft was investigated. A
hopping maneuver to be conducted on-board the International Space Station was designed
for the platform, Astrobee. Software simulations were designed an executed to explore the
hopping. The research question of this thesis, “Is there an ideal mobility for use in space
that uses zero propellant?” The results of this thesis indicate that hopping mobility for use
in space is not only a feasible option but that it can provide a zero propellant option for
mobility in space. The next section addresses further research needs to accomplish a
successful hopping maneuver in space.
A. FUTURE WORK
Future work includes further ground based experiments. The purpose of ground
based experiments is to verify the concept of a hopping maneuver. Two facilities are
available for ground based testing, one at NPS and another at NASA - Ames Research
Center. The two centers provide a granite monolith table for near frictionless
surface representative of the zero gravity environment of space. The SRL’s testbed
facility (Figure 31) is composed of three systems, 1) VICON motion capture system, 2) a
4x4 meter granite monolith table with attached 3D printed ISS handrails, 3) multibody FSS.

56
The 3D printed model of Astrobee’s manipulator arm was created by fellow thesis
student, Justin Komma to provide a real-world test platform to test hopping maneuver on
NPS test-bed and compare with simulation results. The replica of Astrobee’s robotic
manipulator was mounted in such a way that the hopping mobility approach could be tested
with hardware in the loop.
Due to the delays in the launch of Astrobee flight units to the ISS, the hopping
mobility experiment in the ISS was not able to be conducted prior to the completion of this
thesis. All paperwork and ground work has been completed in anticipation for the ISS
experiment. Follow on work includes a more detailed concept of operations for the ISS
experiment. Following the ISS experiment, further analysis will need to be conducted on
the accuracy and propellant savings the hopping mobility maneuver saves if any.
B. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE
The mobility approach of this thesis has implementation for providing resilience
and more capable space assets. Astobatics demonstrates the flexibility of on-orbit
repurposing and augmentation of spacecraft. The ability to free-fly propellantlessly could
enable the servicing of spacecraft in the form of refueling. Astrobatics would enable a space
spacecraft to further the capabilities of national assets in the form of on-orbit assembly.
Large apertures or large structures would no longer need to be assembly by an astronaut
but rather a small dexterous multifaceted vehicle would suffice to safely assemble all
structures in space. Lastly, astrobatics would provide the resilience of spacecraft already
on-orbit in the form of repairs and anomaly resolution. Small vehicles could maneuver into
position to inspect the exterior of damaged satellites to provide real-time anomaly
resolution.
Image a satellite that had complications in launch and is unable to make it to its
desired orbit. What if the satellite could be assisted to its desired orbit? This could happen
one of two ways. The first idea is for the satellite to use the onboard propellant to send it
off into its target orbit. The satellite reaches the orbit but then has no fuel onboard to
complete any mission. Now, insert a servicing satellite with the maneuvering capabilities
developed at NPS. The servicing spacecraft could capture the tumbling spacecraft and with 
57
its dexterous arms could then refuel the orbiting satellite enabling and further mission life.
The second option is the servicing satellite captures the satellite at sub-orbit and the
servicing satellite uses onboard propellant to boost both vehicles to desired orbit.
The amount of money spent on building and launching military satellites must be
protected and preserved. A servicing satellite could provide additional fuel, preform onorbit repairs, maneuver or manipulate the orbiting satellite into new configurations.
